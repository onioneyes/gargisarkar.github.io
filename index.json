    "points": [
      "As a researcher at the intersection of computer security and criminology, I investigate cybercrimes targeting everyday individuals. My work aims to develop efficient and systematic policing procedures to combat these crimes. I have been actively involved in mitigating and synthesizing solutions for cyber-enabled human trafficking and forced criminality affecting victims of trafficking. Currently, I am developing standard operating procedures for police to systematically investigate digital artifacts involved in cybercrimes, incorporating open-source intelligence, and fostering private-government collaboration."
